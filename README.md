# churn Rate Prediction Analysis

Modeling: In order to improve user retention and lower churn, the growth team is interested in understanding why and which users withdraw money from their Robinhood account. A user is considered churned when their equity value falls below $10 for a period of 28 consecutive calender days or longer

Using the datasets given answer the following questions:

a) What percentage of users have churned in the data provided? [4 points] b) Build a classifier (rules like if then etc in python) using "training data" that given a user with their features assigns a churn probability for every user and predicts which users will churn. How well does your classifier perform on the "test data"? Your metric is accuracy, accuracy means (number of correct predictions/number of total predictions) Based on the classifier (model you built) classify each user in the dataset as churned or not churned.
